### This is our experiment definition file.
### It is parsed by quite a simple algorithm, #'s are allowed, but please keep to double quotations and no spaces
### between variable names and equal signs. 
### It can be parsed by run_bulk_exp.py tuned for darknet, Faster-RCNN and YOLOv2v3
### If not training, keep "train_on_dataset= " blank."
