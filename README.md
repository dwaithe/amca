### Labview integration. 
For this project we used Labview 2015. 
For this project it was necessary to install the Labview drivers for the Photometrics Prime Camera.
More details for support can be found here: https://www.photometrics.com/resources/third-party-software/labview
This involves installing PVCAM: https://www.photometrics.com/support/software/
The .vi files used for this project can be found in the labview subdirectory of this repository

### Scripts
In the scripts subdirectory you will find many of the python and IJmacro scripts that I used to make life easier.
Python scripts are written in python 3.5.
- collect_positions.py -- This is the script used to generate a list of positions for the microscope to visit.

### Augmented Reality Microscope schematic and instructions
For this project we developed an attachment to our Olympus IX73 microscope which meant it could be used for Augmented Reality.
